  - Assist the devops team with build pipeline

  - I helped Thomas with the backend for RoommateList integration between the frontend and backend. I documented the functions in the JavaScript function we worked on and did some light testing for the integration to ensure that it functioned as expected. I plan to be working with Thomas in this next part of the sprint to handle the integration between frontend and backend. We will be meeting with Chase and Kyle to make sure that we can get all the information from the frontend and construct what we need for backend to function properly.

  - This week I did integration work between frontend and backend for the roommate list. I talked to Haochen and worked with Bryce to make sure the buttons on the HTML/JavaScript worked and interacted with CRUD functions so we can keep roommate data in local storage.
